# Predicting-ecommerce-customers-device-usage

## About
In the `data.csv` file we have data about the customers in coloumns as `email` `address` , `Avg Session length` , `time on app` , `time on website` , `length of membership` etc. 
Using data exploration and linear regression we try to predict whether the company should prioritize to devote resources towards further development of the mobile application or the website first at hand. 
This prediction would help the company to satisfy the majority of it's users whilst investing minimum resources. 

## In the repository

Download the `data.csv` file and place it in a directory. 
Create a jupyter notebook in the same directory and follow along my `ipynb notebook` in this repository to perform the data exploration and implement a linear regression model on it using scikit learn.
